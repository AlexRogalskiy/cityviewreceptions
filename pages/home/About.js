      In 1928, Salt Lake City Corporation deeded to American Abbey and Mausoleum
      Company 6.5 acres north of the Salt Lake City Cemetery for the
      construction of a mausoleum, crematorium, chapel and gardens. Cecil E.
      Bryan, Americaâ€™s foremost mausoleum architect was commissioned to design
      and erect a stately temple built of stone, marble, bronze, carved woods
      and stained glass that would withstand the ravages of time and be a beacon
      of beauty and memory for Salt Lake City. The property was named the Salt
      Lake Mausoleum and was dedicated for the public in 1931. After a few
      changes in ownership, in 2015, Salt Lake City Memoriam, LLC purchased the
      property and changed the name to the City View Memoriam.
